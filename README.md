# Google Homepage Redesign

This project is a **static redesign** of Google’s homepage using **HTML and CSS**.  
It was created as part of a learning exercise in web integration — focusing on layout, responsiveness, and good HTML/CSS practices.  
And most importantly: having fun with code!

## Creating the HTML Page

- Copied and adapted the base code provided during the workshop by Lilian.  
- Reproduced the visual design of Google’s homepage (logo, search bar, main buttons, footer).  
- Preserved the original layout as closely as possible (spacing, typography, alignment).  
- This version is purely front-end — no functional search logic.

---

## Tools and Practice

- Practiced HTML structuring (header, main, footer, nav, etc.).  
- Worked on CSS layout and positioning (Flexbox and/or Grid), including responsive design.  
- Improved understanding of typography, margins, paddings, and color management.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** → for the page structure.  
- **CSS3** → for styling, layout, and responsiveness (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries).  
- *(Optional)* **Google Fonts** → for typography close to Google’s official style.
